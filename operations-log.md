# Operations Attempt Log

This log documents the git operations attempted in the offline environment while following the requested workflow steps.

- Attempted to check out the `main` branch, but it did not exist locally, so a new `main` branch was created from the current HEAD.
- `git pull origin main` failed because no `origin` remote is configured in this environment.
- `git fetch --all --prune` completed without effect for the same reason (no remotes).
- Checking out `codex/locate-and-fix-a-reproducible-bug` failed because the branch is not present locally and cannot be fetched without a remote.

Further merge and push steps could not be executed without the required remote branches.
